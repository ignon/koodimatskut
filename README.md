# Koodimatskut.fi
[Koodimatskut.fi](https://koodimatskut.fi/) is a carefully curated and arrenged list of high-quality coding learning materials for primary schools (in Finnish).

Powered by Gatsby.js, a static site generator which allows for querying local markdown files with GraphQL, then passing them as props to React components.

The code isn't yet shared with any open-source lisence, but contact me if you are interested in contributing, localization the materials or using the CSS styles / static site generation code for your own projects.
