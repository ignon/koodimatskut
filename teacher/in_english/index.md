## In English
Koodimatskut.fi is a carefully curated and arranged list of high-quality coding learning materials for primary schools (in Finnish). The materials have been curated so that they conform to Finnish coding education standards and are either localized to Finnish or require only basic English proficiency. The games are the property of their respective owners and are provided with a link and the name of their creator. This site is my personal project which doesn't try to compete with any of the mentioned websites, it just tries to make the life of Finnish primary school teachers easier, most of the coding websites have only partial or incomplete Finnish translations, so this site tries to bring the completed ones together.

The screenshots or pictures used for each game are for non-profit, educational, and informational purposes only. If you are the owner of a game mentioned here and wish to have it removed, contact me at arttu.b.makinen (Ã¡t) gmail.com and I'll remove it as soon as possible. This website does not claim any ownership or affiliation with the games listed here.
